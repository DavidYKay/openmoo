This is supposed to be MOO, much as possible. Sacrifices in accuracy will probably be made at some point in the interest of fun, of originality, of including MOO2 features, and of updating the game. Sacrifices in accuracy will be made early on because i'm going to build this first as I remember moo; This is not a direct dissassembley port, but based on my experiences with playing, the manual (Acquired from Abandonia, http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/101/Master+of+Orion.html), Sirian's excellent MoO site (http://sirian.warpcore.org/moo1/index.html), and probably playtest suggestions.

There's two major components to Moo; The Galaxy Map, and the tactical ship combat section. They're pretty much independant; It even looks like they may be seperate executables, in the original game. It's on the list of things to do to create a seperate '1+2' version, using the galaxy from 1 and the ship combat of 2. Later.

MoO is a boardgame; Just a little too complex for a physical board, but it could be done. On the galaxy map, orders are planned, and then executed simultaneously. At the end of that, if there is combat to resolve, the game enters tactical mode to resolve it. Once the turn is over, the game goes back to the galaxy map to plot the next phases orders.

Order Execution:
Planetary Productio
Racial production
Ship Movement
Combat

Planetary Production:
The planet list is cycled through, Planetary production is calculated, taxes are taken out, and things are bought. BC's will be deposited into the Research trasury; I believe that it will be saner for ship production to be handled later (just before the ship movement phase) 
Production: 1/2 the # of colonists, rounded up + the number of factories that
they operate. 

Racial production: 
Each race is cycled through,
