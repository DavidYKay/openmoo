v.1 <-
Single player, explore the galaxy, build stuff. No combat engine, just galaxy
map, unit movement, production. Only the most basic of UI; but I want the
game logic solid

v.2 
Save File, beginings of a PBEM mode.
More work on the UI, 'combat' as well.

v.3
Seperate view and model completely; work on each player being able to
'connect' to a central-server. 
Think about AI
